# Synchrenity Deployment Guide

> Modern deployment for Docker, cloud, scaling, zero-downtime, and best practices.

---

## 🐳 Docker

- Provide a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment
- Example:
```dockerfile
FROM php:8.1-fpm
WORKDIR /var/www/html
COPY . .
RUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

---

## ☁️ Cloud

- Example templates for AWS, Azure, GCP
- Use managed DB, cache, and queue services

---

## 🏁 Zero-downtime

- Use rolling deployments and health checks
- Blue/green or canary deployments

---

## 🩺 Monitoring

- Integrate with ELK, Graylog, or other centralized logging
- Add health check endpoints

---

## 📈 Scaling

- Horizontal scaling via load balancer
- Stateless app servers

---

Customize these templates for your enterprise environment.
